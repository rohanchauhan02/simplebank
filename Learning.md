Transsection Isolation Level

ACID Property

1. Atomicity
-> Either all oeration complete successfully or the transection fails and the db is unchanged.

2. Consistency
-> The db state must be valid after the transection. All constraints must be satisfied.

3. Isolation
-> Concurrent transections must not affect each other

4. Durability
-> Data written by a successful transection must be recorded in persistent storage

Read phenomena

Dirty read

-> A transection reads data written by other concurrent uncommited transection

Non-Repeated read

-> A transection reads the same row twice and sees different value because it has been modified by other committetransection

Phantom read

-> A transection re-executes a query to find rows that satisfy a condition and sees a different set of rows, due t changes by other committed transection

Seralization Anomaly

-> The result of a group of concurrent committed transactions is impossible to achieve if we try to run them sequentially in any order without overlapping.
